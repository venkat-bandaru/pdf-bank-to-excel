# Architecture — PDF Bank Statement → Excel

This document explains *why* the project is built the way it is, so a human or
an LLM joining the project can make consistent decisions without re-deriving
them.

## Goal

Take PDF bank statements dropped into an `input/` folder and emit a matching
`.xlsx` file per PDF into `output/`, using a fixed accounting schema:
`Date | Description | Money Out | Money In | Balance`.

This is a single-business tool. There is no concept of "client" or "tenant".

## Non-goals

- Categorising transactions (no rules engine, no GL coding).
- Reconciling against another ledger.
- A web UI or service. This is a local CLI / script.
- OCR / scanned-PDF support (text-only PDFs are in scope; see "Scanned PDFs"
  below).

## Pipeline

The tool is a linear pipeline. Every stage has one job and a typed input/output,
so it can be tested in isolation and replaced without touching the others.

```
input/*.pdf
   │
   ▼
[1] ingest      — discover PDFs, decide what to process
   │
   ▼
[2] detect      — identify the bank (HSBC / Barclays / generic)
   │              and whether the PDF is text or scanned
   │
   ▼
[3] extract     — pull raw rows out of the PDF using pdfplumber
   │              one extractor module per bank layout
   │
   ▼
[4] normalize   — coerce raw rows into the canonical Transaction model
   │              (parse dates, money, drop rubbish, validate balance chain)
   │
   ▼
[5] export      — write a .xlsx to output/ with the standard columns
   │
   ▼
output/*.xlsx
```

If any stage fails for a given PDF, the file is moved to `failed/` with a
sibling `.log` explaining why. The rest of the batch keeps going.

## Why a strategy pattern for extractors

Bank statements look wildly different across banks. HSBC's tables, Barclays'
tables, and a random building society's tables share almost no structure.
Trying to write one extractor that handles all of them produces a mess of
`if bank == "hsbc"` branches.

Instead: one module per bank under `extractors/`, each exposing the same
`Extractor` protocol (`extract(pdf_path) -> list[RawRow]`). A dispatcher in
`detect.py` picks the right extractor based on text fingerprints in the PDF
("HSBC UK Bank plc", "Barclays Bank UK PLC", etc.). A `generic.py` fallback
uses heuristics for unknown layouts — best-effort, expected to fail
sometimes, that's fine.

To support a new bank, you add one file. You do not modify existing files.

## Scanned PDFs

Some banks issue scanned PDFs where the "text" is actually an image.
`pdfplumber` returns nothing useful for these.

Detection heuristic: if `pdfplumber` extracts fewer than N characters per page
on average (`detect.min_chars_per_page` in `config.toml`), `detect.py`
classifies the PDF as `scanned` and logs the classification.

We do not OCR scanned PDFs. Earlier iterations sketched an OCR path
(`pdf2image` + `pytesseract`); it was descoped because the sample set we
actually need to handle is text-based, and local OCR added install friction
(Tesseract, Poppler) and accuracy problems (1 vs l, 0 vs O misreads) without
a clear payoff. Scanned PDFs flow through the pipeline and produce an empty
`.xlsx`; the log line `kind=scanned` is the signal that no OCR happened.

If scanned-PDF support is needed later, add an OCR module and wire it into
`pipeline.py` between `detect` and `extract`. Update this section accordingly.

The `normalize` stage still validates that running balances chain correctly
(`prev_balance + money_in - money_out == balance`); rows that break the chain
are flagged in the Excel output so a human can spot-check.

## Canonical model

`models.py` defines `Transaction` as a frozen dataclass:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Transaction:
    date: datetime.date
    description: str
    money_out: Decimal | None   # exactly one of money_out / money_in is set
    money_in: Decimal | None
    balance: Decimal | None     # may be None if statement omits it
    confidence: Literal["ok", "low"]  # "low" if balance chain didn't validate
```

Money is `Decimal`, never `float`. Dates are `datetime.date`, never strings.
This is enforced at the `normalize` boundary — extractors return `RawRow`
(strings), and only `normalize` produces `Transaction`.

## Configuration

A single `config.toml` in the project root holds tunable values:

- `input_dir`, `output_dir`, `failed_dir`
- `detect.min_chars_per_page` — threshold for "this is scanned"
- `extractors.priority` — list, controls dispatcher order

No environment variables, no flags. One file, one source of truth.

## Logging

`logging` from the stdlib, configured in `__main__.py`. Every PDF gets a log
line per stage at INFO. Failures are ERROR with a traceback. Logs go to
stdout *and* `logs/run-YYYY-MM-DD.log`. No `print()` anywhere in the codebase.

## Testing

`pytest`. Tests live under `tests/`. Sample PDFs (anonymised — real account
numbers and names redacted) live under `tests/samples/`.

Each extractor has its own test file with at least one good sample and one
known-tricky sample. The pipeline has an end-to-end test that runs the full
flow on a fixture and diffs the resulting `.xlsx` against an expected one.

## Library choices

- **pdfplumber** — best balance of table extraction quality and ergonomics
  for text PDFs. We tried `pypdf` (too low-level) and `pymupdf` (excellent
  but AGPL-licensed, which complicates redistribution).
- **openpyxl** — for `.xlsx` output. Standard choice, no surprises.
- **dataclasses** (stdlib) — over Pydantic. We don't need runtime validation
  at every boundary; the only place validation matters is `normalize`, and
  it's clearer as explicit code than as decorators.
- **tomllib** (stdlib, Python 3.11+) — for `config.toml`. No extra dep.

## Out of scope, deliberately

Things that look tempting but we are *not* adding until there is a concrete
need:

- A plugin system for extractors (just add a file).
- Async / parallel processing (one PDF at a time is fast enough; sequential
  is easier to debug).
- A database (CSV / Excel is the deliverable; persistence is the user's job).
- ML-based extraction (per-bank rules are good enough for known layouts;
  ML adds opacity and model-management overhead).
